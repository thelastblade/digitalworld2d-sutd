    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to overcome the waiting time that is required for a thermometer to reach thermal equilibrium with a water bath before obtaining the temperature. Our solution is to write a program that reads data from a DS18B20 temperature sensor and use machine learning and statistical analysis to predict the actual temperature of a water bath accurately within the range of 10℃ to 60℃ in the shortest time possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on experimental data from the Physical World analysis, we found out that the inital gradient of the temperature of the sensor against time graph is linearly related to the temperature of the water bath. The initial gradient of the first 20 seconds can be determined by the temperature sensor and obtained using python code. As such, a linear regression model can be used to predict the temperature of the water bath given the initial gradient of the temperature against time graph. "
