    "# Introduction\n",

    "The objective is to overcome the waiting time that is required for a thermometer to reach thermal equilibrium with a water bath before obtaining the temperature. Our solution is to write a program that reads data from a DS18B20 temperature sensor and use machine learning and statistical analysis to predict the actual temperature of a water bath accurately within the range of 10℃ to 60℃ in the shortest time possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on experimental data from the Physical World analysis, we found out that the inital gradient of the temperature of the sensor against time graph is linearly related to the temperature of the water bath. The initial gradient of the first 20 seconds can be determined by the temperature sensor and obtained using python code. As such, a linear regression model can be used to predict the temperature of the water bath given the initial gradient of the temperature against time graph. "

    "A water bath is set up in an insulated container of volume 1L, for a given temperature of water bath. A laboratory thermometer is then used to record the temperature of the water bath. The temperature sensor is placed in the water bath to keep track of the temperature reading of the temperature sensor. \n",

    "The function read_temp() records the temperature in degrees Celsius of the water bath. From 0 to 20 seconds, at a time interval of 0.5 seconds, the function collect_data records both the temperature reading, through the read_temp() function, and elapsed time as a tuple. The function appends this data to a list that it returns at time = 20 seconds. \n",
